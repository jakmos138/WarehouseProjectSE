# Warehouse System REST API

## Request and response body syntax
The syntax used for the response structure in this document is similar to JSON, but with types instead of values, for example:
```
{
    key1: type1,
    key2: {
        subkey1: subtype1,
        subkey2: subtype2
    },
    key3: type3
}
```
The possible types are:
### `[type]`
Array of items of type `type`.
### `type?`
Item of type `type` or `null`.
### `bool`
`true` or `false`.
### `int`
Integer.
### `decimal`
Real number with precision given by digits to the right of the decimal point.
### `decimal(n)`
`decimal` with fixed precision â€“ `n` digits to the right of the decimal point.
### `string`
String of characters.
### `timestamp`
Timestamp. *How the timestamp is passed is to be decided.*
### `object`
Generic object. Wherever possible, the full specification of the object is specified rather than `object`.

URL parameters are specified like this in a given endpoint:
`/url/:param`
All URL parameters are `int`s that correspond to resource IDs.

## Request and response structure
The response body is in JSON format. If, for example, the object's description is:
```
{
    key1: int,
    key2: string
}
```
then the following JSON data could be received for that object:
```
{
    "key1": 123,
    "key2": "Hello from API Docs"
}
```
The general form of the response body is:
```
{
    error: string?,
    data: object?
}
```
The full specification of `data` varies between requests.
`data` is not `null` if and only if a success status code other than `204 No Content` is returned.
`error` is not `null` if and only if a `4xx` or `5xx` status code is returned.

The request body follows more complex rules:

- data can be sent as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`. For endpoints that accept files, only `multipart/form-data` is accepted;
- the request body specification never contains nested objects;
- fields not in the specification are ignored.

If, for example, the specification for a request body is:
```
{
    key1: int,
    key2: string,
    key3: int?
}
```
then the request body is expected to have `key1`, `key2`, and optionally `key3` fields. Not passing an optional field is interpreted the same as passing the field with value `null`.
Of course, the types must match.

## Success responses
The following success status codes are typically returned by endpoints with the given methods:

- `200 OK` **GET**;
- `201 Created` **POST, PUT** - the response typically contains the ID of the created resource;
- `204 No Content` **DELETE**
Exceptions from this rule are specified per endpoint.

## Error responses
The following error status codes are common for all (or most) endpoints with given request methods:

- `400 Bad Request` **POST, PUT, DELETE** - Request is malformed. Typically caused by type mismatch in URL parameters, request body, or missing required fields;
- `401 Unauthorized` - User is not logged in;
- `403 Forbidden` **POST, PUT, DELETE** - User is logged in, but does not have sufficient permissions to perform the operation. Required permissions are specified on each endpoint;
- `404 Not Found` - URL is unrecognized;
- `404 Not Found` **GET, PUT, DELETE** - For endpoints with URL parameters, requested resource does not exist;
- `409 Conflict` **POST, PUT** - Adding or updating a resource would cause an invalid state of that resource. Typically caused by a UNIQUE or FOREIGN_KEY constraint violation;
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Unexpected error during request processing. *Let's hope there won't be many of those.*

Exceptions from this rule are specified per endpoint.
