# WarehouseProjectSE Deployment Strategy

Main file exchange method is through a github repository.

Every modification of the system or related files must be first done on a branch dedicated to the team member.

For example, if Jakub decides to modify the documentation he should first do it on his own branch, before touching the main branch.

Each change must contain a relevant commit message describing the scope and context of the change.

After the proposed change is made on the individual branch, the result must be reported to Jakub -> the team leader and other members involved with the scope of the change, for example in case of backend modifications that would be Szymon.

Only after the change is accepted by the leader and related members, can it be merged into the main branch.

All communication between team members happens through our Telegram group chat, or google.meet meetings planned beforehand.
